# NBAExcelTeams - for Spring 2024

This is a working copy of my repo

I'm adding more detail at home.

Jamie add some of his own feature here.

It is simply a demonstration for SDE class!

Build with `.\gradlew build`

The Jar, when run, produces an Excel file that lists the basic information of every NBA Team

Optionally, the Jar can be run with an argument to specify the filename of the excel spreadsheet. If no argument, the default filename is "NBA Teams.xlsx"
